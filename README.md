# Custom Swedish QWERTY Keyboard Layout for Windows

This repository contains a custom keyboard layout for Windows based on the standard Swedish QWERTY layout. The primary modification is the deactivation of the "dead key" mode for the `~` (tilde) and `^` (caret) characters. With this change, you only need to press the key once to type the character, rather than twice.

## Features

- **Based on Swedish QWERTY**: Retains the familiar layout for Swedish typists.
- **No Dead Key Mode for `~` and `^`**: Simplifies typing these characters by removing the need for double keystrokes.

2. **Run the Installer**:

4. **Switch Keyboard Layout**:
   - You can switch between keyboard layouts by pressing `Alt` + `Shift` or `Win` + `Space`, or by clicking the language bar icon in the taskbar.

## Usage

Once installed, the custom keyboard layout can be used just like the standard Swedish QWERTY layout. The only difference is the behavior of the `~` and `^` keys:

- Press `~` once to type `~`.
